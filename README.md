#socialnetworkAPI

The purpose of this project was to create an API for a social networking web application. In this app, users can post their thoughts, create a friend list, and post reactons to their friends' thoughts. This project utilizes a MongoDB database and Express.js for routing, as well as the Mongo ODM. I also availed myself of the dateFormat util for our timestamps. 

All of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for Friends, Users, Thoughts, and Reactions were tested in Insomnia and functioned properly.
